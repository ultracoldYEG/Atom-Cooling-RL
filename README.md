# RL for atom cooling
In this repository, we have three data files: external parameters, actions (control parameters), and atom numbers (on a log scale). 
We also provide a simple script, written in python using Tensorflow's Keras, as an example of training such an RL agent offline before allowing it to conitnue training offline. For simplicities sake, the python file is provided a single script - the only change required after downloading the script and data files is to change the file paths referenced in the code to your own local location.
